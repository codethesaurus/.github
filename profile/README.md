# Code Thesaurus

Code Thesaurus is a polyglot developer reference tool you can use for learning a new language, seeing cheat sheets 
on how to do things, and more! You can use it to compare two programming languages side-by-side, like one you know 
and one you don't. The idea is rather than having to parse a ton of documentation on a language, you can compare 
something you don't know to something you do, which will let you quickly figure out not just what to do but help 
you learn it as well. It's kind of like language immersion but for programming languages.

Code Thesaurus now has over 100 contributors, over 250 pull requests, and 20 languages contributed so far!

## History

Code Thesaurus was an idea developed in 2015 to compare any two languages side-by-side. In 2017, Sarah started 
building out a wireframe site for Hacktoberfest. In 2018, she built more of it along with a CI/CD pipeline. In 
2019, she scrapped the overly-complicated wireframe and replaced it with the simpler Django site that is 
available today.
